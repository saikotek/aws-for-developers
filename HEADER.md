# AWS Services for Developers
AWS services explained in plain English with concepts familiar to developers and compared to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
<br/> 
Some AWS service names are quite cryptic, so I created this table that renames them using terms familiar to developers.
<br/>
This is a work in progress and I will update it as I learn more about AWS and cloud services in general.

## Types of cloud computing
It's good to know types of cloud computing before reading the table below.

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- Provides basic computing infrastructure (virtual machines, storage, networking)
- Most flexible and user-controlled option
- Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine

**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- Handles infrastructure management for you (no need to worry about OS, runtime, etc.)
- Focus on application development
- Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- Provides ready-to-use software applications
- Fully managed by provider
- Examples: Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft 365

# List of AWS Services
There are over 200 AWS services, and this list is non-exhaustive. Feel free to add more services or propose alternative names for them.
Note: This comparison with Azure/Google Cloud is based on general service capabilities and may not reflect all features or recent changes in each platform. 
Service equivalents across platforms may have different feature sets or implementation approaches.
